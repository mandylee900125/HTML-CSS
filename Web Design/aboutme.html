	<h3>Tags</h3> 
		<p>
		The language of XHTML revolves around tags. Every component in a website is contained within a tag. The first tag you create on a website declares the doctype, or the type of file your document will be. 
		</p>
	<h3>Head</h3>
		<p>
		The head of a site includes information for the browser. The information in the head is not seen by the user of the site. It includes keywords for search engines, the title of the website, browser information etc.Below we will create a header of our own for our new website. 
		</p>
	<h3>Body</h3>
		<p>
		The body of the site includes all of the actual site content, including paragraphs, images, audio, animations, backgrounds, and so on.
		</P>
	<h3>Paragraph(p)</h3>
		<p>
		HTML is not sensitive to white space, meaning it doesn't translate the spaces, tabs, and return characters onto the visible body elements of your site. Your browser looks at all of your text in one long line of code.
		</p>
	<h3>Line Break (br/)</h3>
		<p>
		You may not want to add a separate set of tags for each separate paragraph. HTML has a tag for adding a single space, called a line break. Adding a line break tag will allow you to add a single space inside of a paragraph tag. 
		</p>
	<h3>Horizontal Rule (hr/)</h3>
		<p>
		Adds a horizontal line that acts as a separator
		</P>
	<h3>Bold Tag(Strong)</h3>

	<h3>Italic Tag(em) </h3>
